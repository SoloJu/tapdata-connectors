## **Connection Configuration Help**
### Database version 
  HuaWei Open GaussDB Standby 8.1 postgres version 9.2
### **1. Necessary inspections**
    Before using CDC, you need to configure your user machine (the machine where the Agent is currently deployed) in pg_hba.conf of each DN node:
```text
    # Prerequisite: Add the JDBC user machine IP to the database whitelist, Add the following content to pg_hba.conf, and then restart the database:
    # Assuming the JDBC user IP is 10.10.10.10
    host all all 10.10.10.10/32 sha256
    host replication all 10.10.10.10/32 sha256
```
    After configuration, the database needs to be restarted
### Data source parameters
1. Database IP
2. Port
3. Database Name
4. Schema Name
5. Database Username
6. Database Password
7. Logic replicate IP, The IP of the main DN
8. Logical replication port, usually the port of the main DN+1, which defaults to 8001
9. Log plugin, using mppdb_decoding by default
10. Timezone
    
### About CDC Logic replicate
1. DDL statement decoding is not supported, and executing specific DDL statements (such as regular table truncate or partitioned table exchange) may cause decoding data loss.
2. Decoding of column storage and data page copying is not supported.
3. The size of a single tuple should not exceed 1GB. Considering that the decoding result may be larger than the inserted data, it is recommended that the size of a single tuple should not exceed 500MB
4. The data types that GaussDB supports decoding are:
```text
    INTEGER、BIGINT、SMALLINT、TINYINT、SERIAL、SMALLSERIAL、BIGSERIAL、
    FLOAT、DOUBLE PRECISION、
    DATE、TIME[WITHOUT TIME ZONE]、TIMESTAMP[WITHOUT TIME ZONE]、
    CHAR(n)、VARCHAR(n)、TEXT。
```
5. Copying interval partition tables is not supported.
6. Global temporary tables are not supported.
7. After executing a DDL statement in a transaction, the DDL statement and subsequent statements will not be decoded.
8. To parse the UPDATE and Delete statements of a certain Astrore table, it is necessary to configure the REPLICA Identity property for this table. When this table does not have a primary key, it needs to be configured as Full
