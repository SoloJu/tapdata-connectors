### **5.Attention


TiCDC only replicates tables that have at least one valid index. A valid index is defined as follows:
ï»¿
 - A primary key (PRIMARY KEY) is a valid index.
 - A unique index (UNIQUE INDEX) is valid if every column of the index is explicitly defined as non-nullable (NOT NULL) and the index does not have a virtual generated column (VIRTUAL GENERATED COLUMNS).
