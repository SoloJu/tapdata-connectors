### **5.Attention

1. TiDB needs to be deployed in the TapData intranet (same network segment) environment

2. TiCDC only replicates tables with at least one valid primary key index. A valid index is defined as follows:
﻿
    - A primary key (PRIMARY KEY) is a valid index
    
    - A unique index (UNIQUE INDEX) is valid if every column of the index is explicitly defined as non-nullable (NOT NULL) and the index does not have a virtual generated column (VIRTUAL GENERATED COLUMNS)
